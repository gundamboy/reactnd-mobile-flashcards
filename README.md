## Description
Project 3 from the Udacity React Nanodegree.

> "This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input."

## Installation / Running the app
A few things to note here. This app uses [Expo](https://expo.io/learn) for a local testing environment so I recommend you also install it. You can follow the installation instruction from the Expo link.

To install, clone the project or download the zip file and then navigate into the project folder and run
```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
or
```bash
npm install
npm start
``` 

if using expo you can use 
```bash
expo start
```
Next you just scan the QR code with the expo app as detailed in the expo installation instructions from the link above. 

## Project Testing
This project was tested on the following devices using [Expo](https://expo.io/learn):
- Android Simulator running a Pixel 3 XL
- A Samsung Galaxy S10 phone
